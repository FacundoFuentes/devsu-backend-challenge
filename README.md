##About

This is the solution for the backend coding challenge sent by Devsu, it consisted on creating an API that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities in the US and Canada, adding to each city in the response a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)

##Documentation

For documentation I would add detailed information about every endpoint and it's use cases, such as:

Optional parameters
Required parameters
Response examples on both fail and success cases

##References

Geonames provides city lists Canada and the USA http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt
